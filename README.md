# Phaleex
the "Phantomjs Leekwars eXperience"

## What is it ?

This is an attempt to build a fully customizable autoplay for the browser-based game http://leekwars.com/


## Why ?

Playing the game is boring in the long time. We wanted to build a system to autoplay for us based on our preferences.
Most of all, its was a great way to learn the basics of phantomjs.

## Project Status

Still not able to autoplay, almost here.
Coded on free time only, this is a slow process leading to a working autoplay.
