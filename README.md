the "Phantomjs Leekwars eXperience"

### What is it ?

This is an attempt to build a fully customizable autoplay for the browser-based game http://leekwars.com/

### Why ?

Playing the game is boring in the long time. We wanted to build a system to autoplay for us based on our preferences.
Most of all, its was a great way to learn the basics of phantomjs.

### Featrues

* Start from the command line (CLI)
* A profile system allowing you to define your own rules of engagment based on your leek's stats or its foes.
* An auto-upgrade feature based on your profile preferences.

### Project Status

* Still not able to autoplay, almost here.
* Profile system is almost implemented.
* Auto upgrade system is not yet implemented.
* Progress is slow because worked on free time only and interest in doing so decreasing over time.
* The code may not be "state of the art" regarding best practices and all as I made my way trough the learning curve.
